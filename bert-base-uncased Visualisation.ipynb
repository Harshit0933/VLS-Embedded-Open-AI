Then we have a Feedback call with or an alignment call with bot regarding integrations in next steps. And then we have a call with Chunk group. Let's see what they're going to do. Not sure, I don't think they're going to move, but let's see. And then we have a Feedback call with the whole team of ******, exciting, exciting. And we have a follow up call with the company *******, which is also the next step here. So let's see, a lot of stuff coming, maybe happening, some magic on the last day of the month, let's see.\",\"creation_date\":\"2023-08-31 08:44:31.72088 +0200 CEST\"},{\"vl_id\":28582,\"author\":\"Lorenz Westner\",\"content\":\" Morning boys and girls.
